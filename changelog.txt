Campfires now have animated fire. Turns out that I was exporting the file wrong. :S

Added 3d models for the torch and campfires. Textures aren't perfect on the campfire yet.

Added the 'more_fire = {}' line and now the mod runs again, though the fire doesn't do anything when you right click on it.

Renamed and relocated the git repository to match the forum topic
Updated the fire so it can only be placed on the ground.
Added flint that drops from gravel. Will be used for fire starters.
Campfire now drops charcoal.
